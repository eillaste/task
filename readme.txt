The majority of js logic is composed into a single class called Machine,
which includes various lookup tables and functions.
Reels are animated with the help of Greensock.js.
In terms of aesthetic, I aimed at creating something quite gloomy.

TODO: The main class could benefit greatly from a thorough refactoring and do away with
static data that could instead be generated dynamically (number of reels, symbols, combinations).
